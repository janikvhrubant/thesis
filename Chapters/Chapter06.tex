\chapter{QMC-Based Deep Learning Algorithm}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Algorithm description (based on Mishra \& Rusch Algirthm 2.2)
    \item Network Architecture, activation functions and regularization
    \item QMC vs. MC sampling: sample complexity and efficiency
    \item Discussion of smooth vs. non-smooth activations (e.g. ReLU vs. tanh)
    \item Practical considerations: dimensionality, optimal choices
\end{itemize}
